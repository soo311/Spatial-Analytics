# Spatial-Analytics

Spatial Analytics utilizing sea surface chlorophyll-a data [mg m-3] data from the MODIS Aqua satellite in the North Atlantic Ocean. The goal of the project is to understand and evaluate temporal and spatial variabilities around the globe through Chlorophyll-a concentration; Chlorophyll-a is often used as a proxy for biomass and primary production in the ocean - as plants on land go through seasonal cycles of life and death, so do the microscopic plants that make up the base of the oceanâ€™s food chain.
